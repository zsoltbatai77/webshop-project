# Overview

This repository contains a web application project for an online bookstore. The project focuses on the development of a platform that allows users to browse, purchase, and manage books through a web interface. The system incorporates various user roles, including customers and administrators, and integrates features such as a shopping cart, bestseller list, and email notifications. It demonstrates the practical use of web development tools and technologies to manage e-commerce functionalities.

# Task Summary

The project revolves around building a functional bookstore platform, enabling users to search for books by category, manage their cart, and make purchases. The system also includes an admin panel for inventory management. Using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, the application handles asynchronous transactions, data management, and real-time updates efficiently. Key features also include user authentication, role-based access, and integration of email notifications.

# Key Concepts Practiced:

- **E-commerce Development**: Implementing a book shopping system with features like searching, browsing, and purchasing.
  
- **User Authentication and Role Management**: Handling different user roles (customer and admin) with access control.

- **Real-time Data Handling**: Efficiently managing asynchronous requests and updates.

- **MVC Architecture**: Organizing the application into Model, View, and Controller for better scalability and maintainability.

- **Database Management**: Storing and managing book data, user information, and order details using MongoDB.

- **Version Control**: Using Git and GitLab for seamless collaboration and version management.

This project serves as a practical example of web development in an e-commerce context, demonstrating key concepts like system architecture, asynchronous programming, and database integration. It provides valuable insight into the development of a real-world online store, particularly for those looking to build web applications using modern JavaScript technologies.
